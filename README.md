# Full-stack pet adoption platform \<backend\> 


This is a few-week group project of five DCI students. We created a platform where people offering animals for adoption can connect with people who are interested in adoption without any intermediary, smooth, easy and fast. User can register, create an ad to offer a pet, browse the pet gallery, contact owners of pets and chat with them real-time.  This is a full-stack project consisting of two parts:  
- [pawfect-frontend](https://github.com/dci-pawple/pawfect-frontend)
- pawfect-backend (this one).    
Both parts are written in JavaScript(React resp. Node.js). 

## Frontend

The UI is build with React, making use of Context API for state management. For styling we used SCSS and Material UI, Formik for form proccessing and Chat-Engine to create the chat. It is deployed on Netlify.

**React, Context API, SCSS, Material UI, Formik, Chat-Engine**


## Backend

The server is built with Node.js, using the Express.js. Database is being taken care of with help of MongoDB and Mongoose, safely stored on MongoDB Atlas. Images are saved on Cloudinary and the server is deplyed on Heroku.
